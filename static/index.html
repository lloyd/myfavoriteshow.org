        easy</em>, and the user is empowered to make <em>real decisions</em>.  Check

            <em>Shane Tomlinson</em> as Captain Jonas Grumby; Aka: "The
            Skipper" - In moments of exasperation the Skipper would
            swat Gilligan on the head with his cap, but just as often,
            would endearingly call him "Little Buddy."

            <em>Dan Mills</em> as Ginger Grant, who often wears gowns that looked as if they were tailored from S.S.

            <em>Austin King</em> as Roy Hinkley; Aka: The
            Professor. Incongruously, "the Professor" was in fact a
