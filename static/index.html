            <em>Shane Tomlinson</em> as Captain Jonas Grumby; Aka: "The
            Skipper" - In moments of exasperation the Skipper would
            swat Gilligan on the head with his cap, but just as often,

            <em>Dan Mills</em> as Ginger Grant, who often wears gowns that looked as if they were tailored from S.S.
